# Hi, I'm Mehedi Hasan 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻

<img src="https://programmerhasan.info/static/images/me/programmerhasan5.JPG" alt="banner that says Monica Powell - software engineer, content creator and community organizer alongside a cartoon illustration of Monica">
I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL. I recently was selected to be an inaugural <a href="https://stars.github.com/">GitHub Star 🌟</a> based on my involvement in the tech community.  My interest in the React ecosystem led me to launch <a href="https://www.meetup.com/React-Ladies/">React Ladies</a>, a community for women and non-binary ReactJS developers.
